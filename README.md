# resources.data.gov

Resources for open data and enterprise data inventory management.

## Usage

### Editing content

This site uses Netlify to manage its editorial workflow. Content is added and
edited in collections via the Netlify interface, which can be accessed by
approved contributors at
[resources.data.gov/admin](https://resources.data.gov/admin). Collections are
managed via the config.yml file in pages/admin.


## Branches and environments

Environment | Branch | Description
----------- | ------ | -----------
resources.data.gov | `main` | The production instance of r.d.g.
resources-staging.data.gov | `develop` | A preview site used for ad-hoc development or significant changes requiring partner review.
\* | feature branches | Feature branches to preview a single change.

Federalist builds all branches and creates previews for them. Two branches are
special, `main` which is automatically deployed by Federalist to
[resources.data.gov](https://resources.data.gov/) and `develop` which is used as
a staging branch for significant changes.

Deploying to staging is not required. It might be useful for previewing
significant changes to the site that require partner review.
