  **We are currently working to develop a data standards repository in response to [Action 20 of the Federal Data Strategy](https://strategy.data.gov/action-plan/#action-20-develop-a-data-standards-repository), which calls for a data standards repository to accelerate the creation and adoption of data standards across agencies.**  
  
  
  Please join the conversation and provide your input on the following two questions:  

  1) [What types of content would you like to see included in this data standards repository?](https://github.com/GSA/resources.data.gov/issues/157)  

  2) [For any data standards in this repository, what information should be included?](https://github.com/GSA/resources.data.gov/issues/158)  


  You can provide any additional feedback via [Github](https://github.com/GSA/resources.data.gov/issues) or by emailing [datagov@gsa.gov](mailto:datagov@gsa.gov)
