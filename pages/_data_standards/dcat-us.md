description: The DCAT-US schema is the standardized metadata specification for 
  describing all datasets and APIs within a government agency’s comprehensive 
  data inventory. It was formerly known as the Project Open Data Metadata 
  Schema. The standard is based on the international W3C DCAT specification 
  and is used by agencies to compile their dataset listings for inclusion on 
  Data.gov. Under the OPEN Government Data Act and the Open Data Policy, 
  federal agencies are required to publish an enterprise data inventory, 
  provided as a JSON file, using the standard DCAT-US metadata schema and 
  hosted on an agency’s website at agency.gov/data.json. DCAT-US is currently 
  in use by most federal agencies as well as by many state and local 
  governments. 
usage_notes: Data.gov provides a validator to check implementations of the 
  standard and the dashboard tracks the agencies implementing it.
policies_authorities: DCAT-US is the metadata standard associated with the 
  requirements for enterprise data inventories in the OMB M-13-13 open data 
  policy and the Foundations for Evidence Based Policymaking Act Title II, 
  OPEN Government Data Act (Evidence Act). The Evidence Act applies to all 
  agencies. These federal policies do not apply to state and local governments 
  which may have their own policies. However, state and local governments are 
  welcomed to contribute their metadata to Data.gov on a voluntary basis and to 
  do so they must publish their metadata using the DCAT-US standard while 
  omitting any federal-specific metadata elements as noted in the documentation.
