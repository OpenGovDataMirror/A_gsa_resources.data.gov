description: Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN) is a powerful open
  source data management system that makes data accessible by providing tools to
  streamline publishing, sharing, finding, and using data. The Data.gov catalog
  is based on CKAN, a technology that powers many government open data sites.
  Inventory.data.gov is a separate instance of CKAN hosted at GSA on the same
  infrastructure as the Data.gov catalog.
