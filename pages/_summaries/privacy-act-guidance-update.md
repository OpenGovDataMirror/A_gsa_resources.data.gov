resource_name: "OMB Memorandum: Privacy Act Guidance â€” Update"
description: "This memorandum calls attention to three areas and suggests
  specific remedial steps for agencies: (1) Agencies' disclosures of personal
  information from systems of records during the course of litigation; (2) the
  disclosure of personal information from Privacy Act files pursuant to Section
  (b)(2), which allows agencies to make non-consensual disclosures if the
  disclosure would be \"required\" under the Freedom of Information Act; (3) the
  relationship between the exemption provisions of the Privacy Act and those of
  the Freedom of Information Act. Dated May 24, 1985."
