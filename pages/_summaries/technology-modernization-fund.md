description: The Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) is an innovative funding vehicle to give agencies additional ways to deliver services to the American public more quickly, better secure sensitive systems and data, and use taxpayer dollars more efficiently. It is not a free source of money. Approved projects receive incremental funding and technical expertise to ensure project success. The Technology Modernization Board, comprised of Government IT leaders representing proven expertise in technology, transformation, and operations, oversees the TMF. The Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017 authorized the TMF.
