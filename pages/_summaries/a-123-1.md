resource_name: "OMB Circular A-123Â Appendix A: Management of Reporting and Data
  Integrity Risk (OMB M-18-16)"
description: >-
  Pursuant to OMB Circular No. A-123, agencies are required to manage risk in
  relation to achievement of reporting objectives. Prior to this update,
  Appendix A was prescriptive and rigorous in what agencies were required to
  implement in order to provide reasonable assurances over internal controls
  over financial

  reporting (ICOFR). This update balances that rigor with giving agencies the flexibility to

  determine which control activities are necessary to achieve reasonable assurances over internal

  controls and processes that support overall data quality contained in agency reports. Updated June 6, 2018.
